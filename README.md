# Macros plugin

ONLYOFFICE macros use JavaScript language syntax and ONLYOFFICE [Document Builder API scripting notation](https://api.onlyoffice.com/docbuilder/basic). 

The plugin is pre-installed in ONLYOFFICE Enterprise Edition, Community Edition (Document Server + Community Server), ONLYOFFICE Integration Edition, ONLYOFFICE cloud service, and ONLYOFFICE Personal.

## Features

* Rename, edit, remove existing macros.
* Available for text documents, spreadsheets and presentations.

## How to use

2. Click “New” and consult the [API documentation](https://api.onlyoffice.com/plugin/macros) to write the necessary script.
3. Enter your script code and click “Run” to run it within the document.

## How to use VBA-based macros in ONLYOFFICE

Macros written in Visual Basic won’t be compatible with ONLYOFFICE. You can rewrite your old macros to make them work in ONLYOFFICE. 

Use our [API documentation](https://api.onlyoffice.com/plugin/convertingvbamacros?_ga=2.126654729.589713290.1580285135-699576329.1539952318) to learn how to convert macros.
